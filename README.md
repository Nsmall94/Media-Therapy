# Media-Therapy

## Purpose
Media-Therapy is an application to help anyone experiencing a difficult time in their life weather it be a bad day at work, anxiety or something more drastic. Our hope with Media-Therapy is to give you a chance to leave your worries else where and escape in to a comforting book recommended by us based on your search. We also give you the option to save a few books that may spark your interest and you would like to read for later. Everyone experiences misfortune through life we are just hoping to help you manuever past that stage.
